Coursework 1 and Coursework 2 were produce as part of the Operating systems module. University College London, Computer Science.

Implementations are done in C language.


Note for anyone taking this module and reusing my code: feel free to use it for your own coursework. However make sure you COMMENT/DOCUMENT THE CODE BETTER than I did. I received my marks reduced by ~40% as apparently it was not documented properly. Of course no one bothers with re-checking so marks didn't change. Take my advise and good luck!!! :)
